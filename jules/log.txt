Jules' Log

Task: Create a development environment for an Android app that logs GPS data to a YAML file.

Plan:
1. Set up the Android project structure.
2. Configure the build process.
3. Implement the location tracking service.
4. Implement the data recording logic.
5. Implement the main application entry point.
6. Attempt to compile the application.

-- JULES --
Step 1: Setting up project structure.
- Created directory structure: app/src/main/java/com/example/locationtracker, app/src/main/res/*, jules/
- Now creating essential project files.

-- JULES --
All initial plan steps completed.

New Task: Refactor the app to use a configurable 15-minute timer and a modular config file system.

New Plan:
1. Refactor from a Foreground Service to `WorkManager`.
2. Implement a Modular Configuration System.
3. Update the Main Application Logic.
4. Verify the Build.

-- JULES --
All refactoring plan steps completed. The app now uses WorkManager for background tasks and loads the logging interval from `assets/config.yaml`. This is a more robust and battery-efficient solution.
Addressing code review feedback:
- Added a standard .gitignore file for Android projects.
- Updated this log.
Ready for submission.
